                    alt="Tarantino">
                <p> Born March 27, 1963 in Knoxville, Tennessee, is an American director, screenwriter, producer and actor. He gained international fame in the 1990s as an independent film director with his first two feature films, Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), and won rem
                    for what
                    last the Palme d'Or in Cannes. After a third film in 1997 (Jackie Brown), he performs his
                    back with
                    the two parts of Kill Bill (2003 and 2004). His greatest international commercial successes are
                    Django
                    Unchained (2012) and Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood (2019) .

                    Quentin Tarantino's very cinephile style is recognized among other things by his postmodern narrative
                    and no
                    linear, its worked dialogues often interspersed with references to popular culture, and its
                    scenes
                    highly aesthetic but extremely violent, inspired by exploitation films, arts
                    martial or de
                    western spaghetti. Having trained as an actor, he frequently performs small roles in
                    ses
                    own movies, like Mr. Brown's in Reservoir Dogs, Jimmie in Pulp Fiction, Warren in
                    Boulevard
                    death or a mining company employee in Django Unchained.

                    Quentin Tarantino created for production Pulp Fiction the production company A Band Apart, whose name is un
                    tribute
                    to the film Bande à part by Jean-Luc Godard3 while his logo takes the characters in
                    costumes
                    blacks from Reservoir Dogs. He regularly collaborates with his director friend Robert Rodriguez..</p>

                Tarantino style</h2>

                    Tarantino signs the script for all his feature films and pays particular attention to the dialogues. These are abundant and his characters often deliver long monologues which form the most striking moments of his films, "the piece of verbal bravery [supplanting] the action scene" 88. The filmmaker regularly uses a non-linear narrative structure. Indeed, he treats chronology in his scripts, constructed more like a novelist than a screenwriter. He also prefers the term "chapter" to that of "flashback" to name the many back and forth over time. The mixture of temporalities allows him to give key information to spectators when he wishes, without having to resort to dramatic vertical progression89,90. Nevertheless, he still had some suspense. Tarantino likes to put on the same level spectacular actions, particularly bloody, and careful discussions, long, banal and raw, marked by the use of slang. Familiar conversations are characterized by the gradual appearance of a threat that ends with an outpouring of violence91. His style is both admired and decried by the press: some media criticize him for an unhealthy fascination with violence, a classificationological decontextualization of problematic political or historical subjects (the Shoah, American slavery, etc.), an amoral taste for " cool ”and a search for immediate pleasure for the spectator91,92. He is also accused of a taste for rowdy virtuosity, an art of quotation close to pillaging, a dizzying mixture of genres and sub-genres that would remain on the surface of things or even a reductionist vision of history, seen only through the prism of the history of cinema91,93,92.

                    Tarantino announced that he would only make ten films in his career, Once upon a time in Hollywood being the ninth136. His retirement would be a career in literature and cinephilia137. The other films considered would be a science fiction film "without spaceships", a Bonnie and Clyde in Australia in the 1930s, a historical film and a sequel to Kill Bill138. Tarantino is a director who communicates very little about his projects and it is quite difficult to navigate between the real information, the rumors launched by the many fans and the aborted projects. On top of that, his constant work on several simultaneous tracks makes it difficult to discern all the projects he is working on. In general, Tarantino's abundant cinematic culture feeds his projects, which are always original, with the exception of Jackie Brown, adapted from the Punch Creole novel by Elmore Leonard.</p>
